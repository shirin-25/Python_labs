## Technical Requirements
TODO: verify everyone can install the requirements without issue

The `requirements.yml` file contains the necessary Python packages 
to run the notebook.
It has been generated using `conda`, not `pip`.
We recommend you create a new environment with conda, with the 
following command:

`conda env create --name <your_env_name> --file=requirements.yml`

A `requirements.txt` file in the correct format for `pip install 
-r requirements.txt` is nonetheless available as well.

## Introduction
#### Project Goal
The aim of the project is to develop a robust model that utilizes a range 
of demographic and health-related factors to accurately classify 
individuals at risk of developing diabetes. By leveraging advanced 
statistical and machine learning techniques, this project aims to improve 
early detection and provide valuable insights for personalized patient 
care and effective interventions in the field of diabetes prediction.
