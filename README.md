## Technical Requirements
The `requirements.yml` file contains the necessary Python packages to run the notebook.
It has been generated using `conda`, not `pip`.
We recommend you create a new environment with conda with the following command:

`conda env create --name <your_env_name> --file=requirements.yml`

A `requirements.txt` file in the correct format for `pip install -r requirements.txt` is nonetheless available as well.
